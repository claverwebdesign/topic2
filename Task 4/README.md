# Task 4:

In task 4 we address the issue of working with non-geo data.

In this task we research the possiblity of creating a browsable set of web resources parallel to the spatial data. 
A good example of this is the wiki from OpenStreetMap. 
On each page you can see the different components of the spatial data.
This page includes a description of the component. 
 
We've used mediawiki to create a non-geo environment.
We've used the BGT for this example environment. 
The wiki is browseable on the following url:
http://geonovumwiki.spotzi.com/

It is possible to link to this wiki from the platform and if we would have one single authorised dataset it would also be possible to link back.
