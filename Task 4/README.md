# Task 4:

In task 4 we address the issue of working with non-geo data.

In this task we research the possiblity of creating a browsable set of web resources parallel to the spatial data. 
A good example of this is the wiki from OpenStreetMap. 
On each page you can see the different components of the spatial data.
This page includes a description of the component.
