# Task 5:

In task 5 we address the issue of linking the non-geo data (task4) to formal definitions.


A formal definition is the definition that is created by the Authority of the dataset. 
In practice, we see that users of a dataset have a different definition for the same items. 
For example the Authority of a dataset can set the formal definition of an item to "road" while a user can name the item "street".
In this task we try to link the non-formal definition to the formal definition.
