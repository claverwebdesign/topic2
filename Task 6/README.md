# Task 6:

In task 6 we address the issue of creating a toolchain that allows non-geo administrators and data owners to publish and maintain information.


The goal of this testbed is to create a usable spatial data publication platform that can be used by GIS experts but also by non-geo users.
This is only going to work if the platform is easy to understand (for the non-geo users) but also has a lot of functionality for the GIS experts. 

In this task we will try to make the platform easy-to-use without losing functionality.
