# Task 8:

In task 8 we address the issue of Linked Data.

Spotzi will investigate if it's possible to convert the data used by the platform to LD. 
We will need to consider the life-cycle management of these identifiers; the versioning thereof and its relation to the authoritative data source (bronhouder). 
E.g. in some cases resolving a URL may need to include information about the version or history in order to pinpoint hte right variant of the information about the object referenced.
